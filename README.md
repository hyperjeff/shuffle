shuffle
=======
A pre-compiled command-line audio player for macOS.
Very light-weight music player, lots of options.
Default mode is to shuffle music randomly,
but you can also play in non-shuffle mode.

## Unique features:
- Use any collections of audio/music folders at it any time you run it (no pre-ordained music locations)
- Instantly starts even for huge collections of music (in shuffle mode)
- Indefinite rewind in shuffle mode
- Jump forward/back by album (when in non-shuffle mode)

## Install
To install:
```
brew install hyperjeff/tools/shuffle

## About
`shuffle` was written purely in Swift using AVFoundation, and hence is Mac-only.
